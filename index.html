                    I'm a Computer Science student at Carleton University, excited to dive 
                    into the world of technology and software development. With a strong interest in coding, 
                    problem-solving, and programming languages, I have built a solid foundation in areas 
                    like Python, Java, C, SQL and algorithms.
                    
                    I find myself to have critical thinking and creative skills due to the various mathematics 
                    and computer science competitions I have taken part in, as well as the different clubs and 
                    organizations I have made and helped in running.
                    I'm eager to explore fields like data science, web development, and AI. I'm passionate about 
                    growing my skills through hands-on projects, collaborating with others, and staying updated on 
                    the latest tech trends.
                    
                    I am currently working on new projects and I can't wait to see how they pan out.
                    Looking forward to connecting with fellow students, professionals, and mentors as I continue my 
                    path toward a career in technology!
