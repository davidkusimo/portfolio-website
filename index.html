    <pre id="z1">        I'm a first-year Computer Science student at Carleton University, excited to dive 
        into the world of technology and software development. With a strong interest in coding, 
        problem-solving, and learning new programming languages, I have built a solid foundation in areas 
        like Python, Java, and algorithms.
        
        Though early in my academic journey, I'm eager to explore fields like web development, AI, and 
        cybersecurity. I'm passionate about growing my skills through hands-on projects, collaborating 
        with others, and staying updated on the latest tech trends.
        
        I am currently working on new projects and I can't wait to see how they pan out.
        Looking forward to connecting with fellow students, professionals, and mentors as I continue my 
        path toward a career in technology!
