    <pre id="z1">I am currently a High school student at Tommy Douglas Secondary school and have a strong interest 
in Computer Science.
I find myself to have good problem solving and creative skills due to the various mathematics and 
computer science competitions I have taken part in. As well as the different clubs and organizations 
I have made and helped in running.
I am currently working on some projects and I can't wait to see how they pan out.
I am excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share my interests and can help me achieve my goals!

    <h2>Grade 9 Introductory Course Videos</h2>
    <pre>I had the initiative with one of my classmates to reach out to the 
guidance department in my school about helping Grade 8s in their transition 
to high school. So I brought a group of people together to collectively make 
short introductory videos for the many open courses that Grade 8s would have 
the option of choosing from. These videos were used by my school's guidance 
department when they went to present courses to our elementary feeder schools.

One of the departments represented by our videos was the technology department.
Where all of our Computer Science and Computer Engineering courses are situated in.</pre>
